QUESTIONS TO PRACTICE
Coding Exercises
1.Write a function that returns the maximum of two numbers.

2.Write a function called fizz_buzz that takes a number.
If the number is divisible by 3, it should return “Fizz”.
If it is divisible by 5, it should return “Buzz”.
If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should return “FizzBuzz”.
Otherwise, it should return the same number.

3.Write a function for checking the speed of drivers. This function should have one parameter: speed.
If speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
Otherwise, for every 5km above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”.
If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”

4. Write a function called showNumbers that takes a parameter called limit. It should print all the numbers between 0 and limit with a label to identify the even and odd numbers. For example, if the limit is 3, it should print:
0 EVEN
1 ODD
2 EVEN
3 ODD

5.Write a function that returns the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 between 0 and limit (parameter). For example, if limit is 20, it should return the sum of 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20.

6. Write a function called show_stars(rows). If rows is 5, it should print the following:
*
**
***
****
*****

7. Write a function that prints all the prime numbers between 0 and limit where limit is a parameter.

Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators

=====================
Python Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations: + -

Python Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables: =, +=, -=

Python Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values: < ,> = <

Python Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements: 
e g.
x = 5

print(x > 3 and x < 10)

# returns True because 5 is greater than 3 AND 5 is less than 10
x = 5
print(x > 3 and x < 10)


Python Identity Operators
Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:
















ASSIGNMENT
create a file
html file css file and python file
to delete  a folder

help(to know more about command prompt)
cls
mk dir
rmdir name of the folder
============================
ASSIGNMENT DAY TWO 
Build a conversion from Naira to Dollar
and Naira to Dollar.
========================================================

Variables are container. You can store values.
It helps us to hold values.
=======================================================
******Variable rules*****

Variable names must not start with number.
Must not start with symbols (except (_).)
It must describe what you want to assign to it
=========================================================
TO CREATE A FILE AND FOLDER


*** FILE
type nul >filename.extension
e.g type nul > newfile.text
=================================

FOLDER
mkdir name of the file

e.g mkdir fresh
==========================
TO DELETE A FOLDER
rm dir(name of the folder)

TO DELETE A FILE
del file name plus extension
e.g del printed.pdf
========================
DATA TYPES
=================
1. symbols
2. string
3. boolean
4. Integers
5. float
6. sequence ...this is classified into 3:list,tuple,rage.
7. dictionary
8. set

A string is a text that is inside a double quote or a single quote."".
name = variable

"paul" ....value
data can be many.
Value can be one.
==============================
STRING
#str
name = "paul"
print(name)
print(type(name))(This is to show the data type that the variable is holding)
==============================================================================

****Indentation is about spacing. Adding the space where its right and not adding when its not right.***

NUMERICAL DATA TYPE
A whole number is an integer while a decimal number is a float.
j is a complex to differentiate data type.


SEQUENCE
List -Square bracket
Works with sequential order. Use comma to separate value.
Inside a list you can have a topple,interger and a float and complex.
We use square bracker to camp our list []

Tuple is another data type. The difference between the list and topple is the bracket.
Tuple ()
List [](square bracket)
======================================================
SET
This is another data type under python. It is not in order. It is not a sequence. We have curly brackets. 
{}
=================================================================
BOOLEAN
This is true or false.Anytime you're working with Boolean,your first character must be in capital letter.
=====================
DICTIONARY
Your key and value pair. This is not a set.The key is :
"price":7,
==================
INPUT
Input is an input function in pythons to collect info and data from user.
You can assign input to a variables as well.
================================================
CONVERSION OF DATA TYPE
Anything you supply inside an INPUT is a string.
some data type are convertible and some are not convertible

CONVERTIBLE DATA
Input to an Interger.
You cannot add interger and string together.
Convert string to interger
============================================

AUGUST 4,2022
***CONVERSION OF A DATA TYPE TO ANOTHER DATA TYPE***
How can we convert one data type to another
Variable name = "Paul"
Age =  int(name)
We can only convert intergers in a string and not letters.
 we can convert a string to a list.

Convert a list to a string

name = list("paul")
print(name)
=======================
****CONCATINATION***
Bringing interger inside a string. Bringing interger and string together.
name =  "paul"
age = 1
text = "my name is" + name +"i am " + age + "years old"
print(type(name))
A space in programming is a character on its own.

Formated string can bring int and str together.
Comma are used for sequence.
f means formated string.
Anytime you want to bring the value inside a string together,use curly brace.
=======================

TAKE NOTE

OPERATORS
We use assignment operators when assigning a value to variables.
